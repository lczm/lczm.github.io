# End of the P1 Assignment
Submission for the project has been done and the only thing left is the presentation during the demo day tomorrow.

# The Frontend
The frontend has been done, and shows a table of the user attendance. The pictures that each suer used to take attendance is also recorded down and accessable through the REST api to view.

# User
Each user also has their own individual page where you can view their attendance. Every user is given a route through the web browser and dynamically finds out the content of the webpage
