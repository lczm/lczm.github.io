# Everything else
I have finalized a model with decent amounts of accuracy, with faces from my classes as well as the labels.

It currently uses the webcam of the laptop to make predictions and so far, shows decent accuracy.

For now, I just have to work on the linking the front-end that my partner made, polishing it up and making it work with the backend.
