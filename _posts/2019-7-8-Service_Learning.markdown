## Prologue
My first Service-Learning occurance was with [Delta Senior School](https://goo.gl/maps/ioXmD5DVojCKWYvh9). The goal of the Service-Learing was to teach the students at Delta Senior School how to edit a video together, as well as learn some skills on the spot while teaching.

## The first visit
Two weeks before the workshop at NP, we visited Delta Senior School to familiarize ourselves with the students that we will be teaching. As well as to gain a better understanding of their situation, so that we can prepare ourselves for the workshop. It is also to get to know our partners better, so that during the workshop, we will be able to conduct ourselves better and appropriately.

At the same time, we also had to take photos with the students so that they can use the photos during the video editing workshop. Using pictures that they took themselves, around the school, they will be more engaged and invested to learn during the workshop

## The second visit
The second visit we had with the students of Delta Senior School, was at Ngee Ann Polytechnic. We welcomed them into our computer labs and taught them how to use a web video editor, Clipchamp.

Clipchamp allows for the user to quickly edit videos together with just a browser. With just a web browser as a dependency, they will be able to learn how to edit a video from this workshop and take that skill back home.

The teaching of how to edit a video went very smoothly. My partner, Vivien, was very interested with how to edit videos and learnt very quickly. Towards the end of the workshop, Vivien did ask how can the video be saved. This proves to me that the workshop has been a success, as it sparked interest in video editing, and the student was able to learn how to edit videos and make them by herself.

## Epilogue
This was a very meaningful project that the school has allowed me to undertake. I learnt a lot of many different skills while going through with this project. I learnt how to better understand people from different backgrounds and enable myself to be of help to them. Allowing me to become a better person than I was before.
