# Introduction
The opportunity Ngee Ann Polytechnic gave me to go through with Service-Learning, allowed me to go through an experience that I would have not otherwise. It gave me the experience of preparing and structuring a program for students at Delta Senior School. Together with my classmates, we prepared the students to learn how to video edit with Clipchamp, an online video editor,  by the end of Service-Learning.

It gave me a chance to use the skills I have learnt over the years, to teach the students in an understandable manner. Throughout the Service-Learning, slowly but surely improving my communications skills to better understand the students better. 

During the Service-Learning, I have learnt many new skills; Communication skills and Critical thinking. Previously, I was not very good at communicating to people in general, but after Service-Learning, I am able to communicate efficiently and effectly, getting my thoughts across while being understanding of the situation. Being able to speak my thoughts, in a polite and understandable way. 

While preparing for the video editing session, we were tasked to take some photos. It was also the first time I was meeting the student. At the start, I was not able to reach out to the student well enough. However, while we went around taking photos, I got to know the student better and was able to suggest better ideas.

This Service-Learning has certainly enhanced my learning in school. In addition to academic studies, holistic learning, such as Service-Learning teaches a different set of skills that is unique and would not be able to learn from a classroom alone..
