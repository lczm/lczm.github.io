## FP3 Networking Session
In FP3, the school has provided us with the opportunity to talk to various different companies to look for an internship as well as talk to the people who are from the industry. So that the students can potentially gain some insights into the indsutry that they will be working in, in the future. I talked to a few companies, but I will only be mentioning some here.

Gigacover is a company that works with insurance, as well as tech. They provide insurance for freelancers, contract workers and casual workers. They were a interesting company and they offered a Software Engineer intern position, as well as a Data Engineer intern position that I was interested in. I ultimately did apply.

CargoAI is a air freight booking website that uses data and AI to provide the best possible rates. They also generate personalized reports based on current market trends, route price history, previous orders, space availability, and price. I talked to CargoAI and found out that they were looking for a backend engineer. I showed my interest to CargoAI at the end of the Career Networking Session.
