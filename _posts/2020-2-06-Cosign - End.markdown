## End of Cosign
This blog post will talk about the demo day. 

## Demo day
The demo day was a very successful day and fun day. Many people came to our booth and we were able to show off what the application could do. We explained the different processes of how the user could learn a word in sign language with our application. We then also let the people use our application to try to learn sign language.

The model was pretty consistent and was predicting correctly for the most part. Although sometimes the model did not predict correctly, it was right more often than not. This is also considering that it is predicting for different people every single time.

We also received some feedback. The feedback was mainly very positive. The demo day has been very insightful.
