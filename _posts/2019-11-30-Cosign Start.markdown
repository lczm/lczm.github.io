## Start
Cosign is a project that my team is currently working on for the Portfolio 2 project. The theme is AI. After looking around at the Google Play Store for various appications to learn sign language, we have found that most, if not all, only show videos on how to sign each various words.

Hence we thought, well why not show if the user is doing it correctly? This would give the user some sort of feedback while learning.

## Project details
Our team is mainly split into front-end and back-end, of course while still communicating with each other on details. The front-end side will be working on the mobile application. The back-end side will be working on sign language recognition. 

I am working on the back-end side. We have decided that it will be best if we take things step by step, get the basic features working first. Hence we are currently working on recognition static hand signs (Ones where gestures are not required). Afterwards, if time permits, we will work on gesture hand sign recognition.

## How is it going so far
We have built a scrum board to help organize our work between our team members.

As can be seen, we have already started working on some of the features (Done has some of the sticky notes). The ones on the 'Done' section are mainly on the back-end side that I am part of. Such as identifying a dataset, cleaning and preprocessing the dataset. This dataset might need to be expanded in the future, but this will do in the current situation. That is our progress for now, it is going at a decent pace.
