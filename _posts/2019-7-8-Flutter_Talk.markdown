# Introduction
I went for JuniorDevSG Code and Tell May 2019, hosted at [RedHat](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Red+Hat/@1.2759058,103.8451409,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x31da191377716ae1:0x166080ad6b7de256!8m2!3d1.2759058!4d103.8473349). The talk was mostly for Flutter.

## What I learnt from the talk
Flutter is a modern stack of technologies built by Google to solve problems people have been facing for a long time. A modern solution to a modern problem. Being able to compile to both iOS and Android at the same time, with the powers of Hot Reloading enabling fast prototyping and efficient development. With Flutter, I would be able to built mobile applications within a short amount of time and have close to native performance, or even native performance. With a component based system, code is reusable, enabling for better software design. This can help when scaling programs bigger.

I also learnt from the talk that Flutter in itself is currently in its maturity stage. Meaning that if I wanted to build something really specific, there might not be a software library that might be able to accomodate that. It also means that there is a smaller community out there. With a smaller community, it would be more likely that the developer has to solve problems by himself if problems arises.
