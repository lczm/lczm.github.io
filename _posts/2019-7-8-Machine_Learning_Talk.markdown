# Understanding Computer Vision with AI using Tensorflow
I went to the 'Understanding Computer Vision with AI using Tensorflow', hosted by the [Singapore Artificial Intelligence](https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Artificial-Intelligence/) meetup group.

The talk has given me a chance to understand better about machine learning concepts and the usage of Tensorflow in such applications. It has helped me understand the foundations of maachine learning much better than before and be more comfortable when applying such concepts into my applications in the future.

I also learnt about new cutting-edge technologies that are being implemented in the industry, such as [YOLO](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/). It is incredible fast and accurate, demonstrated live during the talk. It was an extremely cool concept that I would not have otherwise known about. Now i would be able to implement such technologies in my future programs.
