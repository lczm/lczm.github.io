# Planning

This week I've been planning how I would proceed to work on the project.  The kinds of technology I would use and how i would go about using each of them.

For the most part, It has been classified into two categories

### Front-End
This part would be handled by my groupmate, Joel.

### Back-End
I would mainly be working on the Back-End, which will mostly be doing the actual face recognition, as well as other features.


Kinds of technologies I might use:


Tensorflow/Keras/Scikit-Learn - This would be used for the machine learning portion of face recognition
Sqlite3 - This would be used for the database portion.


Other different technologies might come and go as I decide whether they fit into the project.
