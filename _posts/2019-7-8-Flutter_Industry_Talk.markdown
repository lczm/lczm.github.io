## Why this talk out of the many?
The flutter talk was the main reason I went to the JuniorDevSG for that month. It was an up and coming exciting technology that allowed for compilation to iOS and Android with native performance.

In addition to that, a week or two before the talk, Google announced during [Google I/O 2019](https://events.google.com/io/) that Flutter can be used for not just mobile, web and desktop, from a single codebase. Making Flutter an even more compelling technology to know more about.

The talk was given by [Haris](https://medium.com/@muhamad_haris), a software engineer working in [PSLOVE](https://pslove.com/) using Flutter.

## The talk
During the talk, he explained the reasons to use and not use flutter.

Reasons to use Flutter:
* Hot reloading when change is detected, as compared to recompiling on native Java
* Fast development with widgets
* Cross-platform compilation to iOS and Android

Reasons not to use Flutter:
* Small community
* Lack of a common state management

Afterwards, he gave a live demo on developing on Flutter, showcasing what is possible with flutter with a [web app he made in the process](https://wordbookapp.com/).

He then used a simple app to show demonstrate how easy it is to to prototype code and see changes with Flutter. He did this by simply changing a Hex Value and within a few milliseconds, the android app followed changes, demonstrating the hot reloading function. He then slowly explained the simplicity of the code, which were in terms of the widget components and how easy it is to use and understand it.

## Epilogue
Through this talk, I have learnt more about Flutter and in general the mobile app ecosystem. There are advantages and disadvantages to everything. With Flutter, it provides mdoern solutions to problems that were faced in the past, however it is still a technology in its maturity stage. 

Despite that, I have decided to learn and use Flutter to build a prototype for [Splash Awards Stage B]() with my group. Going through the pros and cons, It is perfect for a simple prototype that can be done within a short amount of time with a certain elegance to it.
